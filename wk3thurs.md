### Data Science Questions | Week 3 (jan. 26) 
---
- formulating Questions 
  - specific, answered with data, makes clear what exactly is being measured (needs a good sequence of connections) 

- data scientists know nothing is ever completely true or false, while everything is either true or false in computer sceince or mathematics
  - _fuzzy logic_

#### Data Science Process 
- hourglass methodology of science broad topic -> narrow analysis -> broad conclusion 

- modeling the data 
  - can experiment with which model best fits the data set 

- explore the data from different perspectives 

#### Hypothesis Testing  
- you can only reject or fail to reject null hypothesis, you can't actually _prove_ a hypothesis to be true 
  - because there is some external factor involved 
  - be careful saying "this causes this"
  - correlation does not equal causation 

#### Good Questions 
- **Specific**, answerable with data, specify what's being measured, can look for trends 
- Good Qs (answer is impossible to avoid): 
  - How many model 3s will tesla sell in SD during the 3rd quarter?
  - How many students will apply for admission to UCSD in 2030? 
  - How many students should UCSD admit in 2030 for a target class size of 50,000?
- sentiment analysis -- data scientists do this  
- broad question --> specify constructs --> specific measures --> narrow question 
  - good data gets defined -- is very specific & measureable 
  
- think of ways to represent surface (if geographic) 
- wording a questions & deciding what you're asking about needs to be specific and have subtlties 
- how did the number of kn-95 masks sold on amazon since 2020 effect the trash poluting rates in SD county 
  - lots of confounds that could be introduced
  - is this measurement going to answer this question ?
