### Week 3
--- 
- Q: at what scale am i going to ask my question?
- Structured Data* 
  - each row is separated by a line  
- Unstructured data*
**Ethics in Data Science**
> Due tomorrow 
>- D1
>- A1
>- quiz resubmission 

- Fractal: repeating pattern made up of it's self and increases in complexity
- set boundary before looking into data (e.g., fractal) 

**Data science ethics**
- ethics: moral principles that govern a person's behavior of  conucting of an activity 
- pursued in a manner that is equitable with respect for privacy and consent (does not cause undue harm) 

**Intent and Objectivity**
- intent is not required for harmful practices to occur
- data, algorithms and analysis are not objective 
  - it is done by people who often have biases 
  - it uses data which have biases 
-  bias and discrimination driven by data and algorithms can give new scale to preexisting inequities and create new inequalities that never existed 

**9 thinngs to consider to not ruin people's lives w data science**
- **1. The question**
  - is it well posed?
  - does the question imply a conclusion? 
  - do you know something about the context and background of your question? 
  - what is the scope of your investigation? what correlates might you inadvertendtly track? is it possible to answer this question well? 

- **2. The implications** 
  - could the info you gain be used for nefarious purposes?
  - have you considered potential underlying consequences 

- **3. The data** 
  - is there data available? is the data related to your question?
  - do you have enough data to make relable inferences? 
  - what biases does your data have? 
  - if you dont have good data, you might as well just stop
  - biomedical research exclude females (bc they claim they introduce more variability0 
  - GDPR.eu (has data) 

- **4. Informed consent** 
  - voluntary agreement to particupate in research 
  - facebook conducted an experiement to see if they could manipulate people's emotion by manipulating content displayed on one's newsfeed 

- **5. Privacy** 
  - what is the level of risk of your data and how will you mitigate the risks? are all subjects equally vulnerable? 
  - anonymization: removes presonally identifyable information from datasets (PII) 
  - use secure data storage with appropriate access rights 

- **6. Evaluation**
  - do you have a verifiable metric of success> 
  - goodhart's law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
  - when you measure there could be a phenomenon (feedback) causing bias

- **7. Analysis**
  - correlation does not equal causation 
  - what kind of covariats could you be tracking 
  - you could have a third unobservable variable linking correlation between 2 weird variables 
  - measurement error 
  - sample size/selection can effect how we analyze our data

- **8. Transparency and Appeal** 
  - is it interpretable as to how it came to any particular findings? 
  - example: predictive policing uses algorithms to predict crime, and recidivism 
  - in put data could be biased 
  - algorithms and decision are opaque and unappealable 

- **9. Continuous monitoring**
  - healthy models maintain a back and forth with the things in the world they are trying to understand 
  - are you tracking changed in your data? 
  - potential unintended side effects and harmful outputs? 
  - are you striving to update, fix, and maintain your algorithm
