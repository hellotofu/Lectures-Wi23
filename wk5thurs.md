### Week 5: Perceptually aware visualization
---
- color is the set of wavelengths of light relfected from an object 
  - some gets absorbed some gets reflected
  - reflected light = color of object

Human perception of color 
- color constancy - our visual perception is constantly adjusting to compensate for changing surroundings 
- human color perception is context dependent

Rods and Cones 
- Rods: responsible for vision at low light levels; senstivite to intensity (sensitive to light; black and white sensitvity in low light conditions) 
- Cones: 3 types S, M, and L; sesitive to color and responsible for high spatial acuity 

Color Spaces
- how that we have a sense of how we perceive light and color - we can try out different models of color 
- some color spaces are additive/subtractive 

Additive vs subtractive color 
- RBG: red-green-blue; additive scheme
- CMY: cyan-magenta-yellow; subtractive scheme 
- HSV: hue-saturation-value; more natural way to describe color for humans

Luminance equation: perceived intensity due to a color 
- different contributions of red/green/blue components

We perceive the world through contrast
- no contrast, no boundary 
- understanding color contrast will help data scientists create color groupings that are easy to perceive 
- we have terrible perception to blues (lol); highest senstivity to green, terrible sensitivity to blue, medium sensitivity to red 

MachBanding - wavy texture due to color 

Perceived color intensity and lightness is context dependent 

Gamut - range of colors a device can display (typically a subset of human perception; stay away from what cannot be printed when creating for papers) 

Different display technologies have different limitations (eg., color printers - narrow color gamut, subtractive color; NTSC TV - slow refresh, limited resolution, narrow color gamut; etc.) 

Use redundant (Using multiple visual elements to represent one variable) encoding of information -- but just bc there are a bunch of colors, doesnt mean u have you use them all, use/distinguish as needed 

perception is context dependent
