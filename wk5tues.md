Types of Plots 
- single variable 
  - continuous 
  - discrete 
- discrete vs discrete 
- discrete vs continuous 
- continuous vs continuous 

Basic visualizations
- histograms 
- densityplots 
- scatterplot 
- barplot 
  - grouped barplot 
  - stacked barplot 
- boxplot 

Variable types: Plots 
- statistical/distribution of quantitative variable 
  - single variable 
    - histogram (info about single quantitative var) 
    - densityplot (info about single quantitative var)

  - single variable x categorical variable 
    - boxplot (summary of a quantitative var broken down by a categorical var; the middle line shows the median and tells you the typical count across categories)
- count data 
  - count data x categorical variable
    - bar plot (count of vals within single categorical var)
  - count data x 2 categorical variables
    - grouped bar plot (count of vals broken down across 2 categorical vars)
    - stacked bar plot (count/proportion of values broken down across 2 categorical vars) 
- directly view quantitative variables 
  - one var x time
    - line plot (quantitative trend over time) 
  - one var x time x categorical var 
    - multiple lines on the same plot  
  - 2 (or maybe 3) quantitative variables 
    - scatterplot (relationship between 2 quant vars) 
 > can use seaborns to visualize data in pandas and python 
 >- form follows function

Categorical vars 
- barplots
- grouped barplots 
- stacked barplots

Boxplots 
- the box delineates the 25th and 75th percentile. the line down the middle represents the median
- whiskers extend to show to range for the rest of the data, excluding outliers 
- outliers are marked as individual points outside of the whiskers
