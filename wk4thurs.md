### Week 4 - approaches to analysis + inferential analysis 
--- 
- descriptive: the goal of descriptive analysis is to understand the components of a dta set, describe what they are, and explain that description to others who might want to understand the data
  - problem: understanding whether users are nice or mean on youtube 
  - data science question: are the words that people use in their comments more frequently psitive words or negative words?
  - type of analysis: descriptive analysis 
  - youd want to be sure you sample randomly across all YT comments, making sure not to get more comments from one genre over another, or one location over another
    - to understand ALL YT comments, you wouldn't just want to sample from one YT channel or videos in a single language 

- statistic: a quantity computed from a sample
- GIGO - garbange in, garbage out: it is worth spending time at the start of a project to determine if he data you have are garbage. be certain they are actually able to help you answer the question you're interested in
- descriptive analysis: size, missingness, shape, central tendency, variability 
  - size: number of rows and columns you have in your dataset 
  - missingness: important to know how many observations have missing data (also knowing why is important) 
  - shape: it's critical to know the distribution of variables in dataset (normal, skewed, etc.) 
  - central tendency: knowing the mean, median, mode can help you get an indea of what a typical value is for your variables of interest 
  - variability: variability in values in obs helps fill in the rest of the story not told by measures of central tendency - exploratory: the goal is to find unknown relationships etween the variables you have measured in your data set. exploratory analysis is open ended and designed to verify expected of find unexpected relationships between measurements (what can the data tell us)
